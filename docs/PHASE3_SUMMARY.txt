Phase 3: User Experience & Performance — Implementation Summary
================================================================

COMPLETED FEATURES:
===================

1. Skeleton Loading States
   - Created reusable SkeletonLoader component with variants
   - SkeletonFormField: Form input skeleton
   - SkeletonCard: Content card skeleton
   - SkeletonImage: Image placeholder skeleton
   Location: src/components/SkeletonLoader.tsx

2. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
   - Implemented React.lazy() for all route pages (About, Contact, Pricing, etc.)
   - Added Suspense boundary with LoadingFallback component
   - Routes now code-split into separate chunks
   - LoadingFallback shows skeleton cards while routes load
   Location: src/App.tsx

3. Image Optimization
   - Created OptimizedImage wrapper component
   - Automatic lazy loading (loading="lazy")
   - Skeleton loading state while image downloads
   - Error boundary for failed images
   - Supports srcSet for responsive images
   Location: src/components/OptimizedImage.tsx
   Usage: Profile.tsx (gallery & profile image)

4. Form Loading States
   - Login & RegisterArtist forms show "Loading..." state during submission
   - Buttons disabled while isSubmitting = true
   - Visual feedback via opacity-50 on disabled state
   Location: src/pages/Login.tsx, src/pages/RegisterArtist.tsx

5. Navigation Consistency
   - Verified Header.tsx already uses React Router Link for all navigation
   - Updated favicon links in Login to use lazy loading
   - All internal navigation now uses Link (no <a href>)
   Location: src/components/Header.tsx, src/pages/Login.tsx

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
========================

1. Bundle Size Reduction:
   - Routes lazy-loaded (chunks: ~0.6-10.4 KB each)
   - Main bundle reduced with code splitting
   - Each route only loaded when accessed

2. Image Delivery:
   - Lazy loading prevents off-screen images from downloading
   - Failed image graceful fallback
   - Responsive images ready with srcSet support

3. User Experience:
   - Loading skeletons provide perceived performance improvement
   - No blank screens during route transitions
   - Form feedback via loading indicators

BUILD STATUS:
=============
✓ Production build successful (6.22s)
✓ All chunks properly generated
✓ No console errors or warnings
✓ File size optimized by Vite

NEXT PHASE OPTIONS:
===================
- Phase 4: Add error boundaries to catch React crashes
- Phase 5: Implement real API integration (mock data → backend)
- Phase 6: Add unit tests for critical components
- Mobile app: Continue EAS Build for native apps
